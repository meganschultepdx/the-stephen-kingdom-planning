#  The Stephen Kingdom - Capstone project planning

#### By Megan Schulte 7-19-2019

## Description

  This mobile app will be a database for information on Stephen King related movies and mini-series. It will provide users with information specific to how the work is relate to Stephen King, be it writing, directing, or just being based off his literature. This information will be pulled from a Firebase database as a stretch goal. As a stretch goal it will also provide the user with information on where the movies can be viewed online by use of the Utelly API. Because I will be learning how to build a React Native app for the first time and would also like to incorporate some accessibility functions into the app, the content structure will be kept somewhat simple for MVP.

## MVP goals

* splash screen with title, tagline, image and enter button on bottom nav bar that navigates to home screen.
* Home screen with title, about section, movies and displayed in grid of cards that contain movie image, title and info for each movie.
* text reader function.
* Add some animation features to UI.
* Other cool styling ðŸ˜Ž
* Some stretch goals might be easily moved up to MVP goals as I do more research and practice with building React Native app; tying to keep scope pretty simple to start. 

## Stretch Goals

* Movie cards are only the image and title, click on movie to open model with more information on it.
* Movie info is pulled from Firebase.
* Sort function for movies.
* Search funtion for movies.
* Add API call to Utelly so user can see where movie is able to be streamed.
* Deployment to app store.
